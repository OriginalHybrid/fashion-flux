## Overview 
**Description:**
This project seeks to revolutionize the fashion industry by developing an AI-powered platform that provides users the ability to virtually try on clothes in real-time with live generation of garments over their image using cutting-edge techniques like Stable Diffusion and ControlNet. By integrating real-time, high-quality imagery with user photos, we aim to offer a seamless shopping experience and reduce product return rates in e-commerce.

Virtual fashion generation can be a powerful tool for social media influencers by allowing them to effortlessly create and showcase new outfits in different poses without physically owning the items. Influencers can use the platform to virtually try on multiple clothing styles, which can then be shared with their followers as realistic images or videos. This technology enables influencers to create engaging content at scale, experiment with various looks, and promote affiliate or sponsored fashion items without the need for constant physical photoshoots. Additionally, they can instantly collaborate with brands, giving followers a sneak peek of new fashion items in real-time, enhancing brand visibility, and increasing engagement through personalized virtual styling.

Objectives:
    • Develop an AI-powered system that can overlay clothing items on consumer's images in real-time.
    • Ensure realistic rendering of garments, accounting for factors such as body shape, posture, and lighting.
    • Provide seamless integration for online retailers to showcase their clothing inventory.
    • Enhance consumer confidence in purchasing decisions by simulating fashion styling.

Target Audience:
    • E-commerce platforms specializing in apparel.
    • Retail businesses seeking to integrate innovative technologies.
    • Consumers seeking a more personalized and engaging online shopping experience.
    • Social Media Influencers
